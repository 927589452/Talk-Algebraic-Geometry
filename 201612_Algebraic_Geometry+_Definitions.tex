% 
%hello watchers
%say Hi :D

% normally you would have a begin document and a preamble here, but not today

% i am using custom defined environments for my LaTeX Session

\begin{defn}[Complex of $R$-modules \nocite[Eis1]{1.10} ]
% the layout here is begin{environment}[title]
% and i can just start typing text
% are comments as they often are

A \bold{complex} of $R$-Modules is a sequence of modules \( F_{i} \)

% it is not needed to put every low index into brackets, but it is a 
% good habit as bigger indexes may be broken up otherwise

and maps \( F_{i} to F_{i-1} \) such that the compositions \( F_{i+1} \to F_{i} \to \F_{i-1} \) are all zero.

% as you have seen i can start math mode by either using  \$ and \(  \) 
% and my LaTeX did become quite rusty since the last time i used it
% that line gives a hint on your current mode

The \bold{homology} of this complex at \( F_{i} \) is the module 
\[
	% this starts the big math mode
	\ker \left( F_{i} \to F_{i-1} \right)   \/ \im \left( F_{i+1} \to F_{i} \right)
\]

% let us not forget to put a reference, where this definition comes from
% Eis1 Eisenbud-Harris Algebraic Geometry - A second course

A \bold{free resolution} of an \( R\)-module \( M \)

% \( \) is the newer and more resilient way of starting math environments

is a complex
\[
	\mathcal{F}: \hdots \to F_{n} \overset{\to}{\phi_{n}} 
	\hdots \to F_{1} \overset{\to}{\phi_{1}} F_{0}
\]
of free \(R\)-Modules such that \( \coker \phi_{1} = M \) 
and \( \mathcal{F} \)  is exact (sometimes we add `` \( \to 0 \) '' to the right of \(\mathcal{F}\) and then insist that \(\mathcal{F}\) be exact except at \( F_{0} \) ).
We shall sometimes abuse this notation and say that an exact sequence 
\[
	\mathcal{F}: \hdots \to F_{n} \overset{\to}{\phi_{n}} 
	\hdots \to F_{1} \overset{\to}{\phi_{1}} F_{0}
	\to M \to 0
\]
is a resolution of \( M \).  
The image of the map \( \phi_i \) is called the ith syzygy module of \(M \).
A resolution \( \mathcal{F }\) is a \bold{graded free resolution } if \( R \) is a graded ring, the \(  F_{i}\) are graded free modules, and the maps are homogeneous maps of degree 0.
Of course only graded modules can have graded free resolutions.
If for some \( n < \inf \) we have \( F_{n+1}=0 \), 
but \( F_{i} \neq 0 \forall 0 \le i \le n \), then we shall say that 
\( \mathcal{F}\) is a \bold{finite resolution of length} \( n\).
\end{defn}

% wow that was a piece of work, but there are more to come yet.





% BTW even though there are linebreaks in the code, there will be no line breaks in the compiled document.
% as you may see the structure is becoming increasingly complex; therefore we should try to get these structure visable

\begin{thm}[Hilberts syzygy theorem\nocite[Eis1]{1.13} ]
	If \( R = l \left[ x_{1}, \dots ,x_{r} \right] \), 
then every finitely generated graded \( R\)-Module has a finite graded free resolution of lenght \( \le r  \).
\end{thm}

%%%%this is then used to Proof Hilberts Theomrem (1.11) 

%chapter 15 starts on 317

\begin{thm}[Buchberger's Criterion \nocite[Eis1]{15.8}]
	The elements \( g_1,\dots,g_t \) form a Gr\"obner basis \( \iff \ h_{ij}=0 \) forall \( i\) and \(j\)
\end{thm}

%proof by construction lies at 336

\begin{def}[initial term \nocite[Eis1]{325}]
	If \( > \) is a monomial order, then for any \( f \in F \) we define the \bold{initial term of f}, written \( \bold{in}_{>}\left( f \right) \) to be the greatest term term of \( f \) with respect to the order \( > \), and if \( M \) is a submodule of \( F\) we define \( in_{>}\left( M \right) \) to be the monomial submodule generated by the elements \( in_{<} \left( f \right) \) forall \( f \in M \). When there is no danger of confusion we will simply write \( \bold{in} \) in place of \( \bold{in}_{>} \).
\end{def}

%the definition of the monomial orders is optional

\begin{def}[Groebnerbasis \nocite[Eis1]{328}]
	A \bold{Gr\"obner basis} with respect to an order \(  > \) on a free module with basis \( F\) is a set of elements \( g_1, \dots , g_t \in F \) such that if \( M \) is the submodule of \( F \) generated by \( g_1 , \dots,g_t \), then \( in_{>} \left(  g_1 \right),\dots, in_{>} \left( g_t \right) \) generate \( in_{>} \left( M \right)\).
	We then say, that \( g_1, \dots, g_t \) is a \bold{ Gr\"obner basis for \( M \) }
\end{def}
\newtheorem{propdef}[Proposition-Definition]
\begin{propdef}[ \nocite[Eis1]{15.6}]
	Let \( F \) be a free \( S \)-module with basis and monomial order \( > \). If \( f,g_1,\dots,g_t \in F \) then there is an expression
	\[
		f= \sum f_i g_i +f' \text{with} f' \in F, f_i \in S_i ,
	\]
	where none of the monomials of \( f'\) is in 
	\( \left( in(g_1),\dots,in(g_t) \right) \) and
	\[
		in\left( f \right) \ge in\left( f_i g_i  \right)
	\]
	for every \( i \). Any such \( f' \) is called a \bold{remainder} of \( f \) with respect to \( g_1,\dots,d_t \), and an expression 
	\( f=\sum f_i g_i + f' \)
	satisfying the condition of the proposition is called a \bold{standard expression} for \( f \) in terms of \( g_i \).
\end{propdef}
\newtheorem{algo}[Algorithmus]
\begin{algo}[Division Algorithm \nocite[Eis1]{328}]
	Lef \( F \) be a free \( S\)-module with basis and a fixed monomial order. 
	If 
	\( f,g_1,\dots,g_t \in F \)
	, then we may produce a standard expression
	\[
		f=\sum m_u g_{s_u} +f'
	\]
	for \(f\) with respect to 
	\( g_1,\dots,g_t \)
	by defining the indices \(s_u\)
	and the terms \(m_u\) inductively.
	Having chosen 
	\( s_1,\dots,s_p \)
	and 
	\( m_1,\dots,m_p\),
	if 
	\[
		f'_p:=f-\sum_{u=1}^{p} m_u g_{s_u} \neq 0
	\]
and \( m \) is the maximal term of \(f'_p \) that is divisible by some \( in\left( g_i \right) \),
then we choose
	\[
		s_{p+1}=i , \\
		m_{p+1}=m / in\left( g_i \right)
	\]
	This process terminates when either 
	\( f'_p=0 \)or no \( in\left( g_i \right) \) divides a monomial of 
	\( f'_p\);
	the remainder \(f'\) is then the last \( f'_p \) produced.
\end{algo}

\begin{algo}[Buchberger's Algorithm \nocite[Eis1]{333}]
	In the situation of Theorem 15.8, suppose that \( M \) is a submodule of \( F \), and let
	\( g_1,\dots,g_t \in M \)
	be a set of generators of \( M \) .
	Compute the remainders \( h_{ij} \).
	If all of the \( h_{ij}=0 \), then the \( g_i \) form a Gr\"obner basis for \( M \).
	If some \( h_{ij} \neq 0\),then replace 
	\( g_1, \dots,g_t \)
	with 
	\( g_1, \dots,g_t,h_{ij} \)
	, and repeat the process.
	As the submodule generated by the initial forms of
	\(g_1,\dots,g_t,h_{ij} \)
	is strictly larger than that generated by the initial forms of
	\( g_1, \dots,g_t \),
	this process must terminate after finitely many steps.
	The upperbound \[
		b=\left( \left( r+1 \right)\left( d+1 \right)+1 \right)^{2^{(s+1)}(r+1) }
	\],
	where 
	\[
		r = \text{number of variables} \\
		d = \text{maximum degree of the polynomials \( g_i\) , and }
		s = \text{the degree of the Hilbert polynomial ( this is one less than the dimension; it is between \( 0 \) and \(r-1\) ).}
	\]

\begin{def}[\nocite[Eis1]{334}]
	\[
		\tau_{ij}:=m_{ji}\epsilon_{i} - m_{ij} \epsilon_{j} - \sum_{u} {f_{u}}^{\left( ij \right) } \epsilon_{u} 
	\],
	for \( i < j \) such that \( in \left( g_{i}  \right) \) and \( in \left( g_{j}  \right) \)
	involve the same basis element of \( F \).
