%hello watchers
%say Hi :D

% normally you would have a begin document and a preamble here, but not today

% i am using custom defined environments for my LaTeX Session

\begin{defn}[Complex of $R$-modules \nocite[Eis1]{1.10} ]
% the layout here is begin{environment}[title]
% and i can just start typing text
% are comments as they often are

A \bold{complex} of $R$-Modules is a sequence of modules \( F_{i} \)

% it is not needed to put every low index into brackets, but it is a 
% good habit as bigger indexes may be broken up otherwise

and maps \( F_{i} to F_{i-1} \) such that the compositions \( F_{i+1} \to F_{i} \to \F_{i-1} \) are all zero.

% as you have seen i can start math mode by either using  \$ and \(  \) 
% and my LaTeX did become quite rusty since the last time i used it
% that line gives a hint on your current mode

The \bold{homology} of this complex at \( F_{i} \) is the module 
\[
	% this starts the big math mode
	\ker \left( F_{i} \to F_{i-1} \right)   \/ \im \left( F_{i+1} \to F_{i} \right)
\]

% let us not forget to put a reference, where this definition comes from
% Eis1 Eisenbud-Harris Algebraic Geometry - A second course

A \bold{free resolution} of an \( R\)-module \( M \)

% \( \) is the newer and more resilient way of starting math environments

is a complex
\[
	\mathcal{F}: \hdots \to F_{n} \overset{\to}{\phi_{n}} 
	\hdots \to F_{1} \overset{\to}{\phi_{1}} F_{0}
\]
of free \(R\)-Modules such that \( \coker \phi_{1} = M \) 
and \( \mathcal{F} \)  is exact (sometimes we add `` \( \to 0 \) '' to the right of \(\mathcal{F}\) and then insist that \(\mathcal{F}\) be exact except at \( F_{0} \) ).
We shall sometimes abuse this notation and say that an exact sequence 
\[
	\mathcal{F}: \hdots \to F_{n} \overset{\to}{\phi_{n}} 
	\hdots \to F_{1} \overset{\to}{\phi_{1}} F_{0}
	\to M \to 0
\]
is a resolution of \( M \).  
The image of the map \( \phi_i \) is called the ith syzygy module of \(M \).
A resolution \( \mathcal{F }\) is a \bold{graded free resolution } if \( R \) is a graded ring, the \(  F_{i}\) are graded free modules, and the maps are homogeneous maps of degree 0.
Of course only graded modules can have graded free resolutions.
If for some \( n < \inf \) we have \( F_{n+1}=0 \), 
but \( F_{i} \neq 0 \forall 0 \le i \le n \), then we shall say that 
\( \mathcal{F}\) is a \bold{finite resolution of length} \( n\).
\end{defn}

% wow that was a piece of work, but there are more to come yet.





% BTW even though there are linebreaks in the code, there will be no line breaks in the compiled document.
% as you may see the structure is becoming increasingly complex; therefore we should try to get these structure visable

\begin{thm}[Hilberts syzygy theorem\nocite[Eis1]{1.13} ]
	If \( R = l \left[ x_{1}, \dots ,x_{r} \right] \), 
then every finitely generated graded \( R\)-Module has a finite graded free resolution of lenght \( \le r  \).
\end{thm}

%%%%this is then used to Proof Hilberts Theomrem (1.11) 

%chapter 15 starts on 317

\begin{thm}[Buchberger's Criterion \nocite[Eis1]{15.8}]
	The elements \( g_1,\dots,g_t \) form a Gr\"obner basis \( \iff \ h_{ij}=0 \) forall \( i\) and \(j\)
\end{thm}

%proof by construction lies at 336

\begin{def}[initial term \nocite[Eis1]{325}]
	If \( > \) is a monomial order, then for any \( f \in F \) we define the \bold{initial term of f}, written \( \bold{in}_{>}\left( f \right) \) to be the greatest term term of \( f \) with respect to the order \( > \), and if \( M \) is a submodule of \( F\) we define \( in_{>}\left( M \right) \) to be the monomial submodule generated by the elements \( in_{<} \left( f \right) \) forall \( f \in M \). When there is no danger of confusion we will simply write \( \bold{in} \) in place of \( \bold{in}_{>} \).
