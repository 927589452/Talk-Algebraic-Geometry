\begin{defn}[Complex of $R$-modules]
# the layout here is begin{environment}[title]
# and i can just start typing text
# are comments as they often are

A \bold{complex} of $R$-Modules is a sequence of modules \( F_{i} \)
# it is not needed to put every low index into brackets, but it is a 
# good habit as bigger indexes may be broken up otherwise
and maps \( F_{i} to F_{i-1} \) such that the compositions \( F_{i+1} \to F_{i} \to \F_{i-1} \) are all zero.
# as you have seen i can start math mode by either using $ or \(
